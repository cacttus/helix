Fixed issues with the frustum not updating correctly.  It wasn't updating when we moved the mosue.
Also fixed frustum's "up"  the THREE.JS up is actually y=1, not the camera's basis vector.
Fixed the quick UI scaling problem.
Got all the tiles to tile correctly.
Fixed another problem where the tile frame wasn't mapping to the specified TILED frame correctly.

TODO:
Water Animation isn't working anymore.
Random tilesets for Sand and grass (flowers) broken.
Fix character sprite, NPCs, Dialogue, User Interface, Walls, Sprite Grabbing

11.08.19
Got the base world to show with new data format.
This makes it easier to define sprites in Tiled.  Optimally a sprite object definition would be much cleaner.
Next step is to fix tiling and the characters.
After this, character interaction, User Interface, Walls, Grass Animation and of course Sprite Grabbing will be the final addition.

due to the necessity of using actual decals to prevent having to code each tile, we're chainging our data model.
reading in the tile frame data

TODO

is_door
is_player
is_..

Walls
Stairs
Treasure Chest (Copied from legend of kevin)
Docks
Sand
"modular wall" idea. Probably not needed..
TODO: Code for these.

Tiled is more versatile than i thought. 
Going to move the tile definitions into Tiled itself.  This will make it easier to create tiles.

Putting monster definitions in Tiled as well.  This will make things a lot easier.

Genericize the color changer.
Fix hand picking and grabbint

Learned today that if you don't initialize a variable on a TS class it won't have the variable until it is set.

Added 'pond water'
Added a day/night cycle with changes in image gradient.  (Useless for this project but interesting to learn how to do image manipulation with canvases and THREE.)
Removed background cubemap for VR -- in the future we must add it back but also get it to work with the image day/night cycle gradient.
Added 'hard border'
Fixed a few bugs with some of the tiles.
Performance improvement: THREE.JS -> ComputeBoundingSphere was a bottleneck, removing it gave us 5-7 frames.
Sound for hand grabbing.


2019.10.31
Added Tiled Tilesets: Tiled ID's are somewhat autogenerated and are messing up in the engine, so we addeed properties to the Tileset and we're going to parse the Id's from the tile name
Created Tilemap class to separate tile parsing.
Removed hard code tile layers and imported from tileset.
Added tree foliage to be modular
Added Fence
Added Color Change Gradient Picker (kind of a neat thing)

TODO: fix grass collisions
Doorway is broken for some houses due to the DOOR trigger being on them.
BUG_ top tile of char is colliding where bot should be colliding


2019.10.30 
Adding water layer, conduit layer, data_objects layer
started changelog


2019.10.28
Not working in Firefox, or IE, due to some dank code,  Adding support for dynamic VR device addition.
Added a quick UI
Added title screen.
TODO character is now negative due to new UI update.
Happenstance fixed character 'head bobble' due to AnimationSpeed not being recursively updated for tiled animations.

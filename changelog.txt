"modular wall" idea. Probably not needed..
TODO: Code for these.

Tiled is more versatile than i thought. 
Going to move the tile definitions into Tiled itself.  This will make it easier to create tiles.

Putting monster definitions in Tiled as well.  This will make things a lot easier.

Genericize the color changer.
Fix hand picking and grabbint

Learned today that if you don't initialize a variable on a TS class it won't have the variable until it is set.

Added 'pond water'
Added a day/night cycle with changes in image gradient.  (Useless for this project but interesting to learn how to do image manipulation with canvases and THREE.)
Removed background cubemap for VR -- in the future we must add it back but also get it to work with the image day/night cycle gradient.
Added 'hard border'
Fixed a few bugs with some of the tiles.
Performance improvement: THREE.JS -> ComputeBoundingSphere was a bottleneck, removing it gave us 5-7 frames.
Sound for hand grabbing.


2019.10.31
Added Tiled Tilesets: Tiled ID's are somewhat autogenerated and are messing up in the engine, so we addeed properties to the Tileset and we're going to parse the Id's from the tile name
Created Tilemap class to separate tile parsing.
Removed hard code tile layers and imported from tileset.
Added tree foliage to be modular
Added Fence
Added Color Change Gradient Picker (kind of a neat thing)

TODO: fix grass collisions
Doorway is broken for some houses due to the DOOR trigger being on them.
BUG_ top tile of char is colliding where bot should be colliding

2019.10.28
Not working in Firefox, or IE, due to some dank code,  Adding support for dynamic VR device addition.
